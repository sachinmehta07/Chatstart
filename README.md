If the setNestedScrollingEnabled(false) method doesn't stop the scrolling behavior of the RecyclerView, there might be other factors or code affecting the scrolling. Here are a few additional suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

Check if there are any other scrolling-related properties set on the RecyclerView or its parent views that could override the setNestedScrollingEnabled behavior. For example, make sure there are no conflicting attributes or methods like setScrollContainer or setOnTouchListener that could interfere with scrolling.

Ensure that you are calling setNestedScrollingEnabled(false) after setting the adapter and layout manager for the RecyclerView. Placing it before these configurations may not have the desired effect.

Verify that the RecyclerView is not contained within a ScrollView or NestedScrollView. In such cases, the parent scrolling behavior might still be affecting the RecyclerView.

Confirm that there are no other interactions or gestures (such as touch listeners or custom scroll handling) implemented in your code that could override the scrolling behavior.

If none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more details about your implementation, including relevant code snippets or the layout hierarchy where the RecyclerView is placed. This information will help in identifying the potential cause of the scrolling behavior.
